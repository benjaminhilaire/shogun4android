The goal of this game is to kill the foe shogun.


To do so, each player got 8 pawn (including its shogun) wich can move from 1 to 4 cases.
After each move, the number of move possible is changing.


Each move can be made horizontal of vertical, no "jump" is possible.


This app is an exercice, my first Android application.


CHANGELOG :

0.35 : Optimization > Pawn refactor

0.3 : MVC Architecture improved + refactor


0.2 : Code available on SOURCE part, wiki TODO not updated
